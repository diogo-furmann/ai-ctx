Implement a complete Task Management System with the following requirements:

- Tasks have: title, description, due date, status (pending/completed), priority (low/medium/high)
- Features needed: Create new tasks, view task list, edit existing tasks, delete tasks, mark as complete
- UI requirements: Use a table for the task list, modal forms for create/edit, Brazilian date format (DD/MM/YYYY)
- Persistence: Store tasks in localStorage as fallback before API integration
